## 🔧 HOW THE BOLD HIGHLIGHTING WORKS

### AI Processing:
1. AI wraps technical terms in `**double asterisks**`
2. Example: "Developed using **Java** and **Spring Boot**"

### PDF Rendering:
1. Parser detects `**text**` patterns
2. Renders wrapped text in **Helvetica-Bold** font
3. Rest of text uses regular Helvetica
4. Maintains proper word wrapping and line breaks

### Example AI Output:
```
Designed and developed **RESTful backend services** using **Java (Spring Boot/Core Java)** 
and **MySQL**, ensuring scalable, secure, and maintainable code.
```

### Rendered PDF Output:
```
Designed and developed RESTful backend services using Java (Spring Boot/Core Java)
and MySQL, ensuring scalable, secure, and maintainable code.

## ✅ BEST PRACTICES

### For Optimal Results:

1. **Include Metrics**: "Improved performance by **30%**"
2. **Use Specific Technologies**: Not "database" but "**MySQL**"
3. **List All Project Tech**: Every technology used in a project
4. **Detailed Responsibilities**: Minimum 5 per project
5. **Action-Oriented**: Start bullets with verbs (Developed, Implemented, etc.)
6. **Quantify Experience**: "**3 years of experience**" not just "experience"
